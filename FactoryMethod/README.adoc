= _Factory Method Pattern_

*When to use Factory Method Pattern :*

- When you don't know the type of object that you are going to be needing when creating it for example.type is random or have a complex logic when creating the obejct
- The logic for creating a type of objects should be encapsulated and hidden
- The logic for creating a type of objects is duplicate

*About the example:*

- Let's imagine that we have a program that should simulates a farm this farm should have 3 types of animals they should be
randomly disrupted.

*Problems with normal approach:*

1- Create animal logic would be the responsibility of the app class.

2- Create animal logic would be duplicated every time you need to create an animal.

3- There would be a lot of duplicated functions and not very robust code.

*Notes about this pattern:*

- Factories always returns an object.
- Think of `new` key word as not harmful.
- You can have multiple types of factories depending on your business needs.
- Each Factory can has it's own logic when creating a new animal for example you can have a factory which knows about the animals which were created and create balanced world knowing which animal exists less
- Utilize polymorphism when creating the object by passing new and different variables which can effect thr returned object.
